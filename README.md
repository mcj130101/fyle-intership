Tax Calculator in JavaScript
This project implements a simple tax calculator that takes a user's age, income, deductions, and extra income as input and calculates their income tax based on a predefined tax structure.

Functionality:

Users enter their age, income, deductions, and extra income through a web form.
JavaScript retrieves the user input and calculates the taxable income.
The program applies a tax rate based on age:
30% for people under 40 years old.
40% for people between 40 and 60 years old (exclusive).
10% for people 60 years old and above.
Income below 8 Lakhs is not taxed.
The calculated tax amount is displayed on the web page.
